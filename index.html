    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    
    <p>Dear <strong>Eileen</strong>,</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
        <li><time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
        <li><time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Please let me know if this is okay, and if so, which start date you would prefer.</p>
    
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com" title="Important university dates">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
    
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
        <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Please provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know.</p>
    
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Polynesian chicken dance</strong>: A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, where a whole village would dance in a circle like chickens to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</li>
        <li><strong>Icelandic Brownian shuffle</strong>: Before the Icelanders developed fire, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</li>
        <li><strong>Arctic robot dance</strong>: An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later, however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="http://example.com" title="Exotic dance research page">exotic dance research page</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
    <p><strong>Dr. Eleanor Gaye</strong></p>
